# Project Description: Creating a regression model using Sci-Kit Learn's Random Forest Regressor machine learning model.
# Predicting an NBA statistic for a college player based on their college statistics.
# The college player and nba player data is extensively cleaned to ensure accurate and up-to-date information
# is passed through the model.
# The model trains the data and provides a R^2 score and MSE value.
# The model then finds the 10 most accurate predictors and allows the user to input the corresponding value
# per predictor.
# The model then does the calculations and returns the final prediction for the predicted NBA statistic.
